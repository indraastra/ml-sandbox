# Ideas
- Simple control scheme
    -- [DONE] Mouse controls angle of ship
    -- Clicking uses boost
    -- Objective is to avoid obstacles and stay alive as long as 
       possible
- Controllable by AI agent, either local to the game or remotely
  over a TCP socket (which may require sending frames back to agent)
- Use OpenCV and camera module for gesture control
    -- Use red token to control angle
    -- Use appearance of green token to control boost
